After graduating from the University of Glasgow with a degree in Financial Technology, specializing in Data Analytics and AI & ML learning, I was able to develop many hard and soft skills as a consumer insight analyst for a little over half a year. I then took a new step in my career and recently graduated from the Data Science Bootcamp in Le Wagon. As of March 2023 I started my journey as a Data Engineering Consultant. 


I enjoy working on challenging projects that require creative problem-solving and attention to detail, and I am always eager to learn new technologies and programming languages. I am a motivated and collaborative team player who is dedicated to delivering outstanding results on every project I work on. I am passionate about utilizing my skills and knowledge to help businesses to make better decisions and solutions.
